  <h2>Project Background</h2>
  <p>This project is personal to me. My mom works for the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and was also involved in an accident. This raised many questions, and as a data analyst, I decided to investigate. 
    This project analyzes road traffic crash data from Q4 2020 to Q1 2024, focusing on crash frequency, fatality rates, and contributing factors across different states. 
    The goal is to identify trends, high risk areas, and key causes of crashes to inform policy decisions, improve road safety, and reduce fatalities. 
    The analysis provides a comprehensive visual representation of crash statistics, highlighting variations across states, years and quarters. By leveraging this data, the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS), and other stakeholders can implement targeted interventions to enhance road safety for Nigerians.</p>
</section>

<section id="executive-summary">
  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
  <p>This analysis reveals significant disparities in crash occurrences and fatality rates across states in Nigeria between Q4 2020 and Q1 2024.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>There were 216,000 total crashes, with an average of 2.6 vehicles involved per crash during this period.</li>
    <li>Kaduna recorded the highest number of fatalities, while Katsina had the highest fatality rate. The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) experienced the highest number of crashes (24,260), followed closely by Ogun State with 18,900 crashes. Bayelsa had the lowest crash and fatality rates, making it the safest state in this analysis.</li>
    <li>Among crash causes, speed violations (19,634 crashes) and fatigue (12,341 crashes) were the leading factors. Poor weather contributed to 184 crashes, while driving under the influence accounted for 73 crashes. Other factors such as overloading, poor road conditions, dangerous overtaking, and tyre bursts accounted for a total of 19,914 crashes from Q4 2021 to Q1 2024.</li>
    <li>Yearly crash totals showed sharp fluctuations: from 16,565 crashes in Q4 2020 to 65,135 in 2021 ( 293.2% increase), 68,280 in 2022 (4.8% increase), 53,020 in 2023 (22.3% decrease), and 13,310 in Q1 2024 (74.9% decrease).</li>
    <li>Quarters Q4 2020, Q4 2021, and Q4 2022 rank among the top five quarters with the highest crash numbers, with Q4 2021 and Q4 2022 recording increases of 2.84% and 6.16% over Q4 2020, respectively. This pattern suggests possible seasonal trends related to increased travel and activity during the holiday season (October to December).</li>
  </ul>

<section id="insight-deep-dive">
  <h2>Insight Deep Dive</h2>

  <h3 id="crash-trends-over-time">1. Crash Trends Over Time</h3>
  <li>The highest number of crashes occurred in Q4 2022 (18,085), followed by Q3 2022 (17,060) and Q4 2021 (17,035).</li>
  <li>The lowest number of crashes was recorded in Q3 2023 (10,935), indicating a potential improvement in road safety measures.</li>
  <img src="images/Crashes by quarter.png" alt="Crash by quarer" style="max-width: 100%">
  <p>This is a screenshot of total crashes by quarter</p>
  <li>Q4 2020 recorded 16,565 crashes, which increased sharply to 65,135 in 2021 — a 293.2% rise. In 2022, crashes rose slightly by 4.83% to 68,280, followed by a 22.35% decrease to 53,020 in 2023. In Q1 2024, crashes further declined by 74.89% to 13,310.</li>
  <li>Each quarter from Q1 to Q4 in 2022 recorded a high number of crashes compared to the same quarters in other years. In fact, one of the 2022 quarters ranked among the top 7 quarters with the highest number of crashes overall.
     This suggests that the high number of crashes in 2022 was a consistent year long trend rather than isolated to specific quarters. It may also indicate underlying issues such as poor road conditions, policy changes, or other systemic problems.</li>

<section id="fatality-rate-analysis">
  <h3>2. Fatality Rate Analysis</h3>
  <li>Katsina has the highest fatality rate (1.16), followed by Sokoto (1.08), Kano (0.96), Yobe (0.85), and Kaduna (0.80).</li>
  <li>This suggests that while these states may not have the highest number of crashes, the severity of incidents is disproportionately high.</li>

<section id="causes-of-crashes">
  <h3>3. Causes of Crashes</h3>
  <li>Speed violations (19,634 cases) remain the leading cause, followed closely by fatigue (12,341 cases).</li>
  <li>Poor weather conditions (184 cases) and driving under the influence (73 cases) contribute minimally but remain areas of concern.</li>
  <li>Other factors like use of phone while driving, tyre bursts, mechanically deficient vehicles, brake failure, overloading, dangerous overtaking, wrongful overtaking, dangerous driving, bad roads, route violations, road obstruction violations, sleeping on steering, sign light violations, etc., contributed to 19,914 crashes.</li>

<section id="recommendations">
  <h2>Recommendations</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Targeted Interventions in High-Risk States:<br />
      Implement stricter traffic regulations in states with high fatality rates (Katsina, Sokoto, Kano), states with high fatalities from crashes (Kaduna, Ogun, Niger), and states with high number of crashes (FCT, Ogun, Nasarawa). Also deploy road safety awareness campaigns in those states.
    </li>
    <li>Enhanced Driver Education Programs:<br />
      Focus on speed management and fatigue prevention through structured training.<br />
      Introduce mandatory refresher courses for commercial drivers, and require first time drivers to complete all courses before obtaining a license.
    </li>
    <li>Infrastructure Improvements:<br />
      Upgrade road conditions in high risk areas like Katsina, Sokoto, Yobe, Kano and Kaduna to reduce crash occurrences.<br />
      Improve signage and lighting in accident prone zones (FCT, Ogun, Nasarawa, Kaduna, Oyo).
    </li>
    <li>Strengthened Policy Enforcement:<br />
      Increase penalties for speed violations and driving under the influence.<br />
      Implement automated speed enforcement systems or deploy dedicated patrol units in high risk crash zones to identify and penalize speed violators.
    </li>
    <li>Recognition System:<br />
      Establish a system of awards and public recognition for states with outstanding road safety records, to incentivize performance and encourage the adoption of effective safety measures.
    </li>
  </ol>

<section id="clarifying-questions-assumptions-limitations-and-caveats">
  <h2>Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, Limitations and Caveats</h2>

  <h3>Clarifying Questions:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>What is the exact source of the data? (e.g., FRSC, police reports, NBS)</li>
    <li>Is the data complete and accurate? Are there any known biases, limitations, potential underreporting or overreporting? For instance, if rural crash data is missing but urban data is included, the conclusions may be biased toward cities.</li>
    <li>What is the definition of a "crash"? (e.g., injury, fatality, property damage).</li>
    <li>What is the total number of registered vehicles in each state and how do weather conditions, road quality, and vehicle conditions impact crash rates? This would help in calculating more accurate crash rates.</li>
    <li>What are the demographic characteristics of the drivers involved in crashes? (Age, Gender, license status, Driver experience, Occupation (commercial driver?), Location, Vehicle ownership.) These would help in deeper analysis.</li>
    <li>What categories of vehicles (e.g., commercial, private, government or diplomatic) or vehicle types (trailer, tricycle (keke), motorcycle, cars, buses, tankers, minibus, pickups, bicycles or trucks)?</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Assumptions:</h3>
  <p>Vehicle type information was not available in the dataset, so all vehicle types were assumed to be the same for the purpose of this analysis. As a result, this analysis does not distinguish between different types of vehicles (e.g., cars, tricycles, trucks, motorcycles), which may influence crash severity or frequency.</p>

  <h3>Limitations:</h3>
  <p>Driver demographic data (e.g., age, gender) was not available in the original dataset, so it was not considered in this analysis.</p>

  <h3>Caveats:</h3>
  <p>This analysis excludes unreported crashes, which may bias the results towards urban areas where crash reporting is more consistent.<br />
  This analysis does not properly account for other contributing factors like (e.g., overload, tyre burst, brake failure etc.) that may have caused crashes.</p>
